# Image Placeholders

Please replace these placeholder images with your actual cake photos:

## Required Images:

### 1. Hero Image
- **Path**: `/public/cake-hero.jpg`
- **Recommended size**: 800x800px (or higher resolution)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP
- **Description**: Your main featured cake (like the strawberry cake in your design)

### 2. Product Images
Create a `products` folder in the `public` directory and add:

- **Path**: `/public/products/cake1.jpg`
- **Path**: `/public/products/cake2.jpg`
- **Path**: `/public/products/cake3.jpg`
- **Path**: `/public/products/cake4.jpg`
- **Recommended size**: 600x600px (or higher resolution)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP
- **Description**: Your signature cake products

## Tips for Best Results:
- Use high-quality images (at least 1000px wide)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for faster loading
- Use consistent lighting and backgrounds
- Square images work best (1:1 aspect ratio)

## Current Status:
Currently using SVG placeholders. The website will work with these, but replacing them with real photos will make it look professional and appealing.
